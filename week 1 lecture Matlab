#1: evaluate cos(e^3)
> y = cos(e^3)
 
#2: plot y = cos(e^x) from x = 0 to x = 3
> y = cos(e^x);
> x = linspace(0,3,100);
> xlabel('x')
> ylabel('y')
> title('#2')
> plot(x,y)

#3: find roots of x^2 + 5x + 6
> c = [1, 5, 6]  (to use roots func the C from each needs to be taken, doesn't know what x is)
> r = roots(c)



.M scripts eg
%% frut cost script - total cost when buying frut
apples = 5;
oranges = 4;
AppleCost = 1;  % in $
OrangeCost = 0.5; % in $
TotalCost = apples*AppleCost + oranges*OrangeCost

TRACING
%% Rugby_match - scoring a rugby match

%Point allocations
TRY = 5;
CONVERSION = 2;
PENALTY = 3;

%start of game
Australia = 0;
Ireland = 0;

%Game
Australia = Australia + PENALTY;
Ireland = Ireland + TRY;
Ireland = Ireland + CONVERSION
Australia = Australia + PENALTY;
Australia = Australia + TRY


Function Creation
function TotalCost = fruit_cost(Apples,Oranges)
%FRUIT_COST will determine the total cost in   when purchasing fruit

AppleCost = 1; 
OrangeCost = 0.5;

TotalCost = Apples*AppleCost + Oranges*OrangeCost;

end



try it exercise 2
#1 create a function that determines the surface area and volume of a cube, given side length is provided as an input.
function [surface_area, volume] = find_cube_properties(l)

surface_area = 6*l^2;
volume = l^3;
%[s,v] = find_cube_properties  gets the actual answer

end



#2 create a function that will determine magnitude and direction(in radians) of a 2d vector in cartesian form.
function [magnitude, direction] = find_vector_properties(v)
%find magnitude and direction of vector v
% v has to be a vector with two components

x = v(1)
y = v(2)

magnitude = sqrt(x^2 + y^2);
direction = atan2(y, x);
%[m, d] = find_vector_properties([-1,-2])

end

#3 Evaluate Integral(@exp(x)*2x dx, (0,1))
