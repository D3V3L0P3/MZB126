try it functions (MATLAB)
#1: evaluate cos(e^3)
> y = cos(e^3)
 
#2: plot y = cos(e^x) from x = 0 to x = 3
> y = cos(e^x);
> x = linspace(0,3,100);
> xlabel('x')
> ylabel('y')
> title('#2')
> plot(x,y)

#3: find roots of x^2 + 5x + 6
> c = [1, 5, 6]  (to use roots func the C from each needs to be taken, doesn't know what x is)
> r = roots(c)
